# nushell-syntax-vim
Nushell syntax highlighting and indentation for Vim

## Installation
* create the ~/.vim directory and required subdirectories if they do not already exist

    `mkdir -p ~/.vim/ftdetect && mkdir -p ~/.vim/ftplugin && mkdir -p ~/.vim/syntax`

* copy the .vim-files to their corresponding directories in ~/.vim
* restart vim, if necessary

## Notes
I am new to both Nushell and Vimscript, and I am currently learning both at the same time. Please bear in mind that this little project is still very much work in progress. I couldn't find a way to get Nushell syntax highlighting in Vim, so I decided to implement it myself.
Suggestions for improvement are highly appreciated.

Tested with Vim 9.0
